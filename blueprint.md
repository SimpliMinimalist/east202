## Project Structure

    -   `lib/features/orders/search_orders`: Search functionality for orders.

## Features Implemented

### Add/Edit Product Screen
-   Allows creating and editing products.
-   Image picker for adding up to 10 product images.
-   Fields for product name, price, category, stock, and description.
-   Character limit for product name and description fields is only shown on focus.
-   Ability to add product variants.
-   "Add Product Variants" button width is now based on its content and centered.
-   The icon for the "Add Product Variants" button changes from an add icon to an edit icon when variants are present.
-   Draft saving functionality.
-   Sale price functionality with a dedicated bottom sheet widget (`SalePriceBottomSheet`).
-   Display of the original price with a strikethrough when a sale price is active.
-   "Add discount" button is disabled until a valid price is entered.
-   "Add discount" button text changes to "Edit discount" when a sale price is active.
-   Sale price input validation to ensure the sale price is less than the original price.
-   The "Done" button in the sale price bottom sheet is disabled if the validation fails.
-   The sale price is automatically cleared if the bottom sheet is dismissed with an invalid value.
-   The sale price bottom sheet is scroll-controlled to avoid keyboard overlap.
-   Corrected a typo from `_editedDitedProduct` to `_editedProduct`.

## Current Change: Dynamic Variant Button Icon

-   **Goal:** Change the icon on the "Add Product Variants" button to reflect the current state (add or edit).
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Modified the `icon` property of the `OutlinedButton.icon` in `add_product_screen.dart` to be conditional.
    2.  The button now displays an `Icons.edit` icon if product variants exist, and an `Icons.add` icon otherwise.
